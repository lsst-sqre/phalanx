      # Only attempt documentation uploads for long-lived branches, tagged

      # clutter in the docs and failures when a PR doesn't have access to
      # secrets.  This will still trigger on pull requests from untrusted
      # repositories whose branch names match our tickets/* branch convention,
      # but in this case the build will fail with an error since the secret
      # won't be set.
