# This is a separate documentation build just to check links.  We don't check
# links as part of the normal documentation build since, unlike Sphinx errors
# and warnings, we don't want broken links to block a merge.  (Sometimes they
# will be fixed by the same merge, sometimes they're temporary rate limit
# issues.)
#
# Instead, we do an advisory run of link checking on relevant PRs that doesn't
# block merging, and we do a weekly link check to catch any links that have
# gone stale.
