Updating a secret stored in 1Password and VaultSecret
#####################################################

Secrets that are stored in 1Password are synchronized into Vault using the `installer/generate_secrets.py <https://github.com/lsst-sqre/phalanx/blob/main/installer/generate_secrets.py>`__ script.
Once they are in Vault, they are accessible to `Vault Secrets Operator`_, which responds to creation of any ``VaultSecret`` resources in Kubernetes by grabbing the current value of the secret data in Vault.

Vault Secrets Operator reconciles any changes as well by comparing Vault's state with that of any ``VaultSecret`` resources every 60 seconds.
This reconciliation process can take some time of time, so you may not see changes reflected until several minutes have passed.

.. note::

   Note for operators: This automatic reconciliation is not enabled by default.
   It is explicitly turned on by setting the ``vault.reconciliationTime`` key in the Helm chart, which needs to be done in every deployed environment of the Vault Secrets Operator.

So, if you want to make any changes to a ``VaultSecret``'s data, you'll need to:

1. Make the changes in 1Password
2. Run the `installer/update_secrets.sh <https://github.com/lsst-sqre/phalanx/blob/main/installer/update_secrets.sh>`__ script, as described in :ref:`dev-add-onepassword`.
3. Wait a few minutes for automatic reconciliation

Forcing reconciliation
======================

If automatic reconciliation doesn't seem to be working, you can force it to take place by deleting the ``Secret`` that is associated with the ``VaultSecret``.
The ``Secret`` will have the same name as its parent ``VaultSecret``.
Once you delete the ``Secret``, the Vault Secrets Operator should detect the deletion and recreate it quickly.
