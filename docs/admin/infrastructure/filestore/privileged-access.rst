Privileged access to the filestore
##################################

Currently, we do not have any way to make containers with privileged filesystem access available from JupyterHub.

In order to get privileged access to the filestore, you will need access to ``kubectl`` with admin privileges to Kubernetes cluster you want to work on.

Procedure
=========

Save the following file as ``copier.yaml``.
You may need to edit it to point to the correct filestore.
If you need multiple filestores present (for instance, for copying data between environments), then you will need to create multiple ``Volume``\ /``VolumeMount`` pairs so multiple filestores are present within the container.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: copier.yaml

   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: copier
     namespace: copier
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: main
       image: ubuntu:latest
       args: [ "tail", "-f", "/dev/null" ]
       volumeMounts:
       - mountPath: /mnt
         name: share
     volumes:
     - name: share
       nfs:
         path: /share1
         server: 10.13.105.122
         # 10.87.86.26 is IDF dev
         # 10.22.240.130 is IDF int
         # 10.13.105.122 is IDF prod

Spin up this Pod_ and log into its shell:

.. code-block:: bash

   kubectl create ns copier
   kubectl apply -f copier.yaml
   kubectl exec -it -n copier copier -- /bin/bash -l

Once you do that, you have a root prompt and the instance filestore is mounted at ``/mnt``.
*With great power comes great responsibility.*

When you're done, delete the namespace.
This will also destroy the privileged pod:

.. code-block:: bash

   kubectl delete ns copier

Examples
========

- Get usage data by username, sorted by usage, largest at the bottom:

  .. code-block:: bash

     du -s -BM /mnt/home/* \
     | sed -e 's/\s\+/,/' \
     | sed -e 's|/mnt/home/||' \
     | sort -nr

- Make an archival copy of user ``foo``\ â€™s previous ``.local`` file for analysis:

  .. code-block:: bash

     tar cvpfz /tmp/foo-local.tgz /mnt/home/foo/.local.20210804223021
