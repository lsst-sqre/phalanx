alert-stream-broker â€” Alert transmission to brokers
###################################################

The Alert Stream Broker is responsible for rapid dissemination of alerts (from observatory operations) to community alert brokers.
It is built on top of `Apache Kafka`_ and uses `Apache Avro`_ as the schema for alerts.

For testing during construction, the alert-stream-broker application includes an alert stream simulator, which periodically posts a static set of alerts to allow testing the alert pipeline.
During normal observatory operations, the alerts will instead come from the Alert Production pipelines.
