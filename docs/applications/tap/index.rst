tap â€” IVOA Table Access Protocol
################################

TAP_ (Table Access Protocol) is an IVOA_ service that provides access to general table data, including astronomical catalogs.
On the Rubin Science Platform, it is provided by `lsst-tap-service <https://github.com/lsst-sqre/lsst-tap-service>`__, which is derived from the `CADC TAP service <https://github.com/opencadc/tap>`__.
The same service provides both TAP and ObsTAP_ schemas.

The TAP data itself, apart from schema queries, comes from Qserv.
The TAP schema is provided by the separate :px-app:`tap-schema` application.

See :px-app-upgrade:`tap-schema` for information on how to update the TAP schema.
