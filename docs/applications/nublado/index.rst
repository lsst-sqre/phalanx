nublado â€” JupyterHub/JupyterLab for RSP
#######################################

The Nublado application provides a JupyterHub and JupyterLab interface for Rubin Science Platform users.
It includes a Kubernetes controller that, besides creating user lab pods, prepulls lab images and can provide per-user WebDAV file servers.

The JupyterHub component and its proxy are deployed via `Zero to JupyterHub <https://hub.jupyter.org/helm-chart/>`__ with a custom configuration.
The Nublado controller is deployed alongside it as a separate FastAPI service.

Nublado user pods are created under the ``nublado-users`` Argo CD application.
WebDAV file servers are created in the ``fileservers`` Kubernetes namespace and the ``nublado-fileservers`` Argo CD application.
