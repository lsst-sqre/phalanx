Google provides a `managed service for Prometheus`_.
In Phalanx environments provisioned on `GKE`_, we'd like to use this for as much as we can to avoid the effort of running our own metrics and monitoring infrastructure.
Unfortunately, the `managed kube-state-metrics`_ package does not provide ``kube_pod_container_status_last_terminated_reason`` or ``kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total``, both of which are needed to alert on container OOM kills in the most reliable way.
This app installs our own `kube-state-metrics`_ and configures the Google Cloud managed service for Prometheus to scrape it.

Prerequisites
=============

* Managed service for Prometheus is installed in the GKE cluster.
  This is probably configured in the `idf_deploy repo`_.
