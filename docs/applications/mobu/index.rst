mobu â€” Integration testing
##########################

mobu is the continuous integration testing framework for the Rubin Science Platform.
It runs some number of "monkeys" that simulate a random user of the Science Platform.
Those monkeys are organized into "flocks" that share a single configuration across all of the monkeys.
Failures are reported to Slack using a Slack incoming webhook.
