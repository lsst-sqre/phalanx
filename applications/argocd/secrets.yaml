"admin.plaintext_password":
  description: >-
    Admin password for Argo CD. This password is normally not used because
    Argo CD is configured to use Keycloak, Google, or GitHub authentication,
    but it is used during installation and is useful as a fallback if external
    authentication is not working for some reason. This secret can be changed
    at any time.

"admin.password":

    bcrypt hash of the admin password. This is the only version of the admin

    automatically if the admin password is changed.

"server.secretkey":
