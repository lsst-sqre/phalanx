grafana-admin-password:
  description: >-
    The password for the initial Grafana admin user. This is needed even though
    we use the auth proxy because:
    * You need to log in as this user when installing Grafana to make another,
      auth-proxy-auth'd user a Grafana admin
    * These creds get injected as env vars into the Grafana pod, and Grafana
      uses them to auth to its own API to configure itself upon startup.
