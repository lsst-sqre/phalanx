    Credentials used to authenticate the front-end and worker pods to
    the S3 bucket used for rubintv assets.  These should be read-only
    credentials.  RubinTV never creates or modifies assets, but simply
    consumes those rapid-analysis put there.
# There is also an optional pull-secret, probably shared instance-wide,
# that isn't yet quite figured out in the new secrets framework.
