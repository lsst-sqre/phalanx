  # The schema registry is bundled together in the same application as the
  # Kafka broker because Strimzi Registry Operator expects everything (the
  # broker, its secrets, its users, and the StrimziSchemaRegistry custom
  # resource) to be in the same namespace.

    version: 2.1.0

  # alert-stream-simulator is bundled together with the broker too for a
  # similar reason: the Strimzi EntityOperator can only watch a single
  # namespace, so all of the Secrets associated with KafkaUsers are in this
  # namespace - and the alert-stream-simulator needs those credentials to
  # connect.
