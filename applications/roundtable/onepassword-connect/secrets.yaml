    Credentials used by the 1Password Connect API server to access 1Password
    vaults. This credential is created when the Secret Managements workflow
    is created and has access to all of the vaults served by that 1Password
    Connect server. It is separate from the 1Password Connect tokens, which
    are issued for each environment and have access only to the vault for
    that environment.

    This is a base64-encoded version of the credentials file for the Connect
    server created as part of the secrets automation workflow. (In other
    words, the static secret itself is the base64-encoded version of the
    JSON, and when written into a Kubernetes ``Secret`` resource, it will be
    base64-encoded twice.) This secret can be changed at any time.
