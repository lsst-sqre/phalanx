    # Rubin Science Platform APIs

    <Lede>Integrate Rubin data into your analysis tools with APIs.</Lede>

    To access most APIs you need an [*access token*](/auth/tokens).
    See Rubin's guide [Creating user tokens](https://rsp.lsst.io/guides/auth/creating-user-tokens.html) to learn more.

    ## Table Access Protocol

    You can access catalog data using the Table Access Protocol (TAP)
    service with popular tools such as
    [TOPCAT](http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat) (GUI) and
    (pyvo)[https://pyvo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html]
    (Python package). The TAP endpoint is:

    ```
    https://rsp.lsst.ac.uk/api/tap
    ```

    See Rubin's tutorial [Authenticating from TOPCat outside the Science Platform](https://rsp.lsst.io/guides/auth/using-topcat-outside-rsp.html)
    to learn more about accessing TAP datasets from your own computer.

       <a href="https://rsp.lsst.ac.uk/portal/app/">
         <Card>Table of counterpart associations between Gaia DR3 and CatWISE2020. Uses probabilistic
    cross-match algorithms as described by Wilson & Naylor (MNRAS, 2017, 2018a,b) and Wilson (RNAAS, 2022). Sources are returned either as a pairing, in which the Gaia and WISE objects are the same astrophysical source detected twice, or as non-matches, with that particular object in one of the catalogues having a corresponding flux upper limits in the opposing catalogue, and entries include various pieces of metadata such as the probability of the match/non-match, likelihood of match on purely position or brightness grounds, and information on the level to which objects suffer contamination due to hidden and unresolved background sources."
