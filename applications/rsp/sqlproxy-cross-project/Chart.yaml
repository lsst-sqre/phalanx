# Normally, we would put the tag of the Docker container here and have the
# deployment default to that value.  However, in this case, since the image is
# maintained externally and we want Renovate to send us PRs for version
# updates, the version is tracked only in values.yaml and this version is not
# used.
# appVersion: "0.1.0"
