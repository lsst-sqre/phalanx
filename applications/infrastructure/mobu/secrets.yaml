app-alert-webhook:
  description: >-
    Slack web hook to which to post internal application alerts. This secret
    is not used directly by mobu, but is copied from here to all of the
    applications that report internal problems to Slack. It should normally be
    separate from mobu's own web hook, since the separate identities attached
    to the messages helps make the type of mesasge clearer, but the same web
    hook as mobu's own alerts can be used in a pinch.

ALERT_HOOK:

    Slack web hook to which mobu should report failures and daily status.
