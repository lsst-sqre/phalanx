    # Rubin Science Platform APIs

    <Lede>Integrate Rubin data into your analysis tools with APIs.</Lede>

    To access most APIs you need an [*access token*](/auth/tokens).
    See our guide [Creating user tokens](https://rsp.lsst.io/guides/auth/creating-user-tokens.html) to learn more.

    ## Table Access Protocol

    You can access catalog data using the Table Access Protocol (TAP)
    service with popular tools such as
    [TOPCAT](http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat) (GUI) and
    (pyvo)[https://pyvo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html]
    (Python package). The TAP endpoint is:

    ```
    https://data.lsst.cloud/api/tap
    ```

    See our tutorial [Authenticating from TOPCat outside the Science Platform](https://rsp.lsst.io/guides/auth/using-topcat-outside-rsp.html)
    to learn more about accessing TAP datasets from your own computer.
