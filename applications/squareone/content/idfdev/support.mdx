# Get help with the Rubin Science Platform on idf-dev.lsst.cloud

This is SQuaRE’s development environment for the RSP. If you're not a
member of the SQuaRE team, you’ll want to try a more public RSP environment
first:

- [data.lsst.cloud](https://data.lsst.cloud) — for most users, including DP0 delegates
- [usdf-rsp.slac.stanford.edu](http://usdf-rsp.slac.stanford.edu/) — for Rubin staff
- [data-int.lsst.cloud](https://data-int.lsst.cloud) — for Rubin RSP developers
