  # -- Target CPU utilization of butler deployment pods

  # I/O bound.  CPU usage can start creeping up if we have many queries running
  # simultaneously (due to serialization overhead and spatial postprocessing.)
  # In this case the thread pool and database connection pool are probably
  # oversubscribed long before we hit 100% cpu usage, so we want to get more
  # replicas up at fairly low CPU usage.
