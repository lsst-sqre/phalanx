github-app-webhook-secret:
  description: >-
    Atlantis works by receiving webhook requests from GitHub when certain
    things happen on pull requests. GitHub hashes these requests with the value
    in this secret, and Atlantis does the same and checks that the hashes
    match, in order to verify that the request actually came from the expected
    GitHub app integration.

    This value is also configured in the GitHub UI for the matching GitHub
    application. If we need to change this value, the Phalanx secret must be
    updated, and the value must be changed in the GitHub UI.
