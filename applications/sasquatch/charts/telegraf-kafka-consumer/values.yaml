    # "_", these would be "a_0"..."a_3".
    union_field_separator: ""
    # -- Union mode: this can be one of "flatten", "nullable", or
    # "any".
    # If empty, the default is "flatten".  When "flatten" is
    # set, then if you have an Avro union type of '[ "int", "float" ]'
    # for field "a", and you have union_field_separator set to "_", then
    # measurements of "a" will go into Telegraf fields "a_int" and
    # "a_float" depending on their type.  This keeps InfluxDB happy with
    # your data even when the same Avro field has multiple types (see
    # below).
    # One common use of Avro union types is to mark fields as optional
    # by specifying '[ "null", "<type>" ]' as the union type.  If this is
    # set to "nullable", the plugin will not change the field name by adding
    # the type, but will silently discard fields whose values are null.
    # However, the measurement will still contain any other fields.
    # The last possible value is "any".  With this value, the plugin will
    # not change the field name and will just put in whatever value it
    # receives.
    # WARNING: if you use "nullable" with more than one non-null type, or
    # if you use "any", and Telegraf is feeding InfluxDB, InfluxDB will
    # associate that field with the first type it sees for a given
    # its value.  If it receives another measurement with a different
    # type in that field, it will discard that entire measurement.  Be
    # sure you know what you're doing if you use the "any" type, or
    # "nullable" with more than one non-null type.
    # For Rubin, "nullable" is usually the right choice.
    union_mode: "nullable"
    # -- Timestamp format. Possible values are "unix" (the default if unset), "unix_ms",

    # At Rubin, use "unix" timestamp format for SAL timestamps.
