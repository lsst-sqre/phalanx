    # Union mode.
    #
    # If empty, the default is `flatten`.  When `flatten` is set, then if you
    # have an Avro union type of `[ "int", "float" ]` for field `a`, and you
    # have union_field_separator set to `_`, then measurements of `a` will go
    # into Telegraf fields `a_int` and `a_float` depending on their type.
    # This keeps InfluxDB happy with your data even when the same Avro field
    # has multiple types (see below).

    # One common use of Avro union types is to mark fields as optional by
    # specifying `[ "null", "<type>" ]` as the union type.  If this is set to
    # `nullable`, the plugin will not change the field name by adding the
    # type, but will silently discard fields whose values are null.  However,
    # the measurement will still contain any other fields.
    #
    # The last possible value is `any`.  With this value, the plugin will not
    # change the field name and will just put in whatever value it receives.
    #
    # WARNING: if you use `nullable` with more than one non-null type, or if
    # you use `any`, and Telegraf is feeding InfluxDB, InfluxDB will associate
    # that field with the first type it sees for a given its value.  If it
    # receives another measurement with a different type in that field, it
    # will discard that entire measurement.  Be sure you know what you're
    # doing if you use the `any` type, or `nullable` with more than one
    # non-null type.
    #
    # For Rubin, `nullable` is usually the right choice.
