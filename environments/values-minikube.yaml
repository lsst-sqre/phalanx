# The primary constraint on enabling applications is the low available memory
# of a GitHub Actions runner, since minikube is used for smoke testing of new
# Helm configurations. minikube also doesn't have access to data, at least
# currently, which substantially limits the applications that can be
# meaningfully deployed.
