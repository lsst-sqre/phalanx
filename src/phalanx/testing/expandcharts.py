"""Expand Helm charts for testing.

Discover the list of supported environments, find all charts that have changed
relative to master, and then expand those charts into directories for each
chart and environment pair and a values.yaml file for that environment.

This is a workaround for limitations in the helm/chart-testing tool, which
doesn't understand multi-environment patterns.
