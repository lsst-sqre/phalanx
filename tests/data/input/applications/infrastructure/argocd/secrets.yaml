"admin.plaintext_password":
  description: >-
    Admin password for Argo CD. This password is normally not used because
    Argo CD is configured to use Google or GitHub authentication, but it is
    used by the installer (which cannot use external authentication) and is
    useful as a fallback if external authentication is not working for some
    reason. This secret can be changed at any time.
  generate:
    type: password
"admin.password":
  description: >-
    bcrypt hash of the admin password. This is the only version of the admin
    password exposed to the running Argo CD pod. It will be updated
    automatically if the admin password is changed.

    type: bcrypt-password-hash

"dex.clientSecret":
  description: >-
    OAuth 2 or OpenID Connect client secret, used to authenticate to GitHub or
    Google as part of the authentication flow. This secret can be changed at
    any time.
"server.secretkey":
  description: >-
    Key used to validate user session cookies. Argo CD will generate this
    secret if it is missing, but we provide it because the Argo CD secret is
    managed via a VaultSecret.

    type: password
